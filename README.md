# Resource Management in Data Center

Our purpose is provide an integration tool to manage the resource across entire datacenter and cloud environments, include CPU, memory, storage, and other compute resources.
Base on this tool, we can provide the service to run applications (e.g., Hadoop, Spark, Kafka, Elastic Search) with scheduling, monitoring and auto scaling.
